         👏 Schools with high economic disadvantage and small classroom sizes show they put in the effort. Unfortunately, their efforts haven’t translated to a desirable college attendance percentage. It’s worth further investigating and assisting to address their struggle.<br>
  - ✅26% of schools fall under 50% of 4th Grade Math with P + A grade passing.<br>
  - ✅ Hall of Fame: Match Charter Public School, Quincy Upper School, Sherborn Elementary School<br>
