**The Analysis and Commentary:**<br><br>
**1. Visuals and Insights**
**The Dashboard:** [Linked Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/quy.tran4833/viz/DashBoard_17376769592380/Dashboard1?publish=yes)<br>
I began by exploring the dataset to understand the distribution of variables and identify any missing values. Visualizations were created to observe trends and correlations between variables. Statistical analyses, including chi-square tests and stepwise regression, were conducted to determine significant predictors of product uptake.<br>

<img src="images/TravelDashBoard.jpg?raw=true"/><br>

  - Cities in tier 1 have the largest product taken, with the lowest average income and the highest number of trips, followed by tier 3, which has the highest average monthly income.<br>  
  - King Product customers have the highest average monthly income and are likelier to live in tier 3 cities.<br>
  - Basic Product attracts the most extensive customer base, especially among children, and welcomes the most visitors. Its youthful clientele and the highest average Property Star rating distinguishes itself. <br><br>
