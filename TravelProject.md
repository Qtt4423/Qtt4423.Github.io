## **The Algorithm of Escape: A Statistical Dive from Passport to Crafting Perfect Vacations Packages**
 
---
**Background:**<br>
  Does the thought of a vacation üõ´ make your heart üíì sing like mine? I often daydream about moments from my past vacations with sandy beaches üê¨ and mountain üöû retreats. If you‚Äôve ever traveled through vacation packages, you will know the trick is finding the right one for your tripüß≥.  But have you ever wondered how travel companies create the perfect vacation packages tailored just for you? I recently embarked on a project to explore this question and uncover how data can help a travel company refine its offeringsüëè.

**Why THIS Project?:**<br>
  The motivation behind this project was both personal and professional. As someone who loves travelingüëô, I‚Äôve always been curious about how companies know which vacation packages to promote. The travel industry is increasingly competitive, and I wanted to understand how data can enhance marketing strategies‚úçÔ∏è. This project was unique because it aimed to optimize a company‚Äôs marketing budget and create tailored experiences for potential travelersüõÑ.

**What Readers Will Gain:**<br>

We‚Äôll uncover key customer insights, discover what influences purchasing decisions, and explore surprising findings that challenge conventional wisdom.ü´∞üèª<br>

**The Analysis and Commentary:**<br><br>

**1. Visuals and Insights**
**The Dashboard:** [Linked Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/quy.tran4833/viz/DashBoard_17376769592380/Dashboard1?publish=yes)<br>
I began by exploring the dataset to understand the distribution of variables and identify any missing values. Visualizations were created to observe trends and correlations between variables. Statistical analyses, including chi-square tests and stepwise regression, were conducted to determine significant predictors of product uptake.<br>

  - Cities in tier 1 have the largest [product taken](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/quy.tran4833/viz/TravelProject-ProductTypebyNo_TripsPersonChildren/ProdTaken-IncomebyCityTier?publish=yes), with the lowest average income and the highest [number of trips](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/quy.tran4833/viz/TravelProject-ProductTypebyNo_TripsPersonChildren/NumberofTrips-AgebyCityTier?publish=yes), followed by tier 3, which has the highest average monthly income.<br>
