###-	Bottom 10 HS Grad %: Springfield Public Day High School leads the chart
###-	What contributes to differences in schools' outcomes?
      Both are significant since the P value is close to 0. Number of Observations: 340
      1. Class size: 
         R2= 0.189728 -> explain almost 19%
      2. Economic Disadvantage %
         R2= 0.379253 -> Explain nearly 37%
      ==-> Economic Disadvantage % has a higher (negative) impact on College Attendance than Class Size.==
###-	🏆 Which schools do well despite limited resources?
      Measure by high % disadvantage and large classroom size with high College Attendance %:
      - 🥇Match Charter Public School
      - 🥇Quincy Upper School
###-	Are there meaningful regional differences within MA? 
      4th grade Math (14/53 or ==26%== district is under 50%)

**Concise Summary:**<br>
      Even with a $306 billion annual budget, the 1 million students in Massachusetts schools performances are:
      - % of College Attendance had a more substantial negative impact by Economic Disadvantage % than Class Size
        Schools with high economic disadvantage and small classroom sizes show they put in the effort.  
        Unfortunately, their efforts haven’t translated to a desirable college attendance percentage.
        It’s worth further investigating and assisting to address their struggle.
	- 26% of schools fall under 50% of 4th Grade Math with P + A grade passing.
	- Hall of Fame: Match Charter Public School, Quincy Upper School, Sherborn Elementary School
	- Struggling Leader: Springfield Public Day High School, Tec Connections Academy Commonwealth Elementary School.
