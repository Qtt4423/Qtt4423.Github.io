## From ABCs to PhDs: 
Navigating the Maze to the Ideal School for Future Geniuses 

**Background:**
Unless you are a born genius, your parents spend all the resources and time to have their children accepted into the best school in the area.  My family is no exception.  Education is one of the most significant investments in our society. 
In Massachusetts, schools allocate a remarkable $306 billion. This funding influences the educational experiences of nearly 1 million students in 1,861 schools. However, are these resources delivering the expected outcomes?

**Why Should You Pay Attention:**
If you are a parent, teacher, policymaker, or simply someone interested in the future, it is essential to grasp how schools in your state perform. 
This dashboard breaks down key data to reveal where the money goes and how schools measure up in areas like academic performance and funding allocation.
